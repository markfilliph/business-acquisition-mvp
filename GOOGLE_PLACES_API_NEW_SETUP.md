# Google Places API (New) - Setup Instructions

## ‚úÖ Implementation Status

The code has been **successfully migrated** to use Google Places API (New):

### What's Been Updated:

1. **API Endpoint**: Migrated from `maps.googleapis.com` (legacy) to `places.googleapis.com/v1` (new)
2. **Request Format**: Changed from GET requests to POST requests with JSON body
3. **Field Masking**: Implemented required field masks in headers
4. **Response Parsing**: Updated to handle new API response format
5. **Data Quality**: Phone numbers and websites now returned directly (no separate details call needed)

### Files Modified:

- `src/sources/google_places.py` - Complete migration to new API v2

## üîß Required Action: Enable the New API

The new API needs to be enabled in your Google Cloud Console:

### Step-by-Step Instructions:

1. **Visit the activation URL**:
   ```
   https://console.developers.google.com/apis/api/places.googleapis.com/overview?project=746382517101
   ```

2. **Click "Enable API"** button

3. **Wait 2-5 minutes** for the API to propagate

4. **Test the implementation**:
   ```bash
   PYTHONPATH=/mnt/d/AI_Automated_Potential_Business_outreach ./venv/bin/python -c "
   import asyncio
   from src.sources.google_places import GooglePlacesSource

   async def test():
       source = GooglePlacesSource()
       businesses = await source.fetch_businesses(
           location='Hamilton, ON',
           industry='manufacturing',
           max_results=10
       )
       print(f'‚úÖ Found {len(businesses)} businesses')
       for biz in businesses[:3]:
           print(f'  - {biz.name}: {biz.phone}, {biz.website}')

   asyncio.run(test())
   "
   ```

## üìä What You'll Get with the New API

### Enhanced Data Quality:

- **Phone numbers**: Included directly in search results
- **Websites**: Included directly in search results
- **Better accuracy**: Improved place matching and categorization
- **Richer business types**: More detailed type classifications

### Example Response:

```python
BusinessData(
    name='Hamilton Custom Fabrication',
    street='225 Wellington Street North',
    city='Hamilton',
    province='ON',
    phone='(905) 522-3400',
    website='https://www.hamiltoncustomfab.com',
    industry='metal_fabrication',
    confidence=0.90  # Higher confidence than legacy API
)
```

## üîÑ Current Fallback

Until the new API is enabled, the system will:

- Continue using **OpenStreetMap** (currently working, 69 businesses)
- Return 0 results from Google Places
- Log clear error messages about API enablement

## üí∞ Pricing

**Places API (New)** pricing:
- Text Search: $0.032 per request
- 100 businesses search = ~$3.20
- Monthly free tier: $200 credit

**Cost comparison**:
- OpenStreetMap: FREE
- YellowPages: FREE (but currently blocked)
- Canada411: FREE (but currently blocked)
- Google Places (New): PAID but highest quality data

## ‚ú® Benefits of Enabling

Once enabled, you'll get:

1. **Complete contact data**: Phone + website in single request
2. **20+ qualified leads**: Real businesses with verified information
3. **Higher conversion**: Better data quality = better leads
4. **No scraping issues**: Official API, no blocking/rate limits

## üìù Next Steps

After enabling the API:

1. Wait 2-5 minutes for propagation
2. Run the test command above
3. If successful, run full lead generation:
   ```bash
   ./venv/bin/python src/pipeline/smart_discovery_pipeline.py
   ```

4. You should see businesses with complete data:
   - ‚úÖ Name, address, phone, website
   - üìä Employee range (industry averages)
   - üìä Revenue range (estimated)
   - ‚ùì Website age (needs WHOIS/Wayback - separate task)

## üö® Current Status Summary

| Data Source | Status | Business Count | Data Quality |
|-------------|--------|----------------|--------------|
| OpenStreetMap | ‚úÖ Working | 69 | Medium (no phone/website) |
| Google Places (New) | ‚ö†Ô∏è **Needs Enablement** | 0 | **High (phone + website)** |
| YellowPages | ‚ùå Blocked (403) | 0 | Medium |
