## Warning Analysis

### Warning Distribution

| Warning Type | Count | Impact |

| **NO_WEBSITE** | ~10 | Limited online presence makes due diligence harder |
| **Multiple** | ~5 | Both HIGH_VISIBILITY + NO_WEBSITE |

### Most Common Warnings

1. **HIGH_VISIBILITY (20+ reviews)**
   - Triggered by: Large review counts
   - Action: Verify single-location SMB vs chain/franchise
   - Examples: Cotton Factory (784 reviews), Wholesale Club (379 reviews)

2. **NO_WEBSITE**
   - Triggered by: Missing website
   - Action: Verify still operating via Google Maps/recent reviews

## Comparison to Validated Leads (Nov 3)

### What We Learned from FINAL_VALIDATED_LEADS_20251103_165454.csv

That file had 20 leads but included problematic entries:
- ❌ Container57 (Shopify - should exclude)
- ❌ Emerald Manufacturing Site (location label - should exclude)
- ❌ VP Expert Machining (revenue $2.69M - too large)
- ❌ Welsh Industrial (revenue $2.68M - too large)
- ❌ Stoney Creek Machine (revenue $2.57M - too large)

**Our filters caught these issues:**
- ✅ Container57 - Excluded by retail filter
- ✅ Emerald Site - Excluded by location filter
- ✅ VP Expert, Welsh, Stoney Creek - Would be excluded by size filter if we had real revenue data

### Improvements in This Batch

1. **Better industry diversity** - 5 industries vs mostly manufacturing/wholesale
2. **Balanced distribution** - Exactly 20 per industry (no skew)
3. **Clean exclusions** - Only 2 exclusions, both correct
4. **Clear priorities** - 40 HIGH vs 60 MEDIUM (40% immediate outreach ready)

## Next Steps

### Immediate Action (40 HIGH Priority Leads)

**Ready for outreach today:**
- 8 Manufacturing companies
- 8 Wholesale companies
- 8 Professional Services firms
- 8 Printing companies
- 8 Equipment Rental companies

**Action:** Begin outreach immediately (no manual review needed)

### Manual Review Required (60 MEDIUM Priority Leads)

**Estimated Time:** 60 leads × 5 min = **300 minutes (~5 hours)**

**Review Process:**

2. **NO_WEBSITE leads (~10)** - Confirm still operating via Google Maps
3. **Multiple warnings (~5)** - Deep dive research required

**Prioritization within MEDIUM:**
- Review manufacturing/wholesale first (core business focus)
- Then professional services, printing, equipment rental

### Week 1 Plan

**Day 1-2:**
- Outreach to 40 HIGH priority leads
- Begin manual review of manufacturing/wholesale MEDIUM leads (20 leads × 5 min = 100 min)

**Day 3-4:**
- Continue manual review of remaining industries (40 leads × 5 min = 200 min)
- Follow up on initial outreach responses

**Day 5:**
- Compile results
- Adjust filters based on learnings
- Plan next batch if needed
