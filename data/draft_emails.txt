EMAIL #1: Fiddes Wholesale Produce Co
================================================================================

SUBJECT: Confidential Inquiry - Future of Fiddes Wholesale Produce

Dear Owner/Leadership of Fiddes Wholesale Produce,

I hope this message finds you well. My name is [YOUR NAME], and I'm reaching out
regarding a potential acquisition opportunity for Fiddes Wholesale Produce Co.

I've been researching established Hamilton businesses, and Fiddes stood out for
several reasons:

   ✓ Nearly 29 years of successful operations (since 1997)
   ✓ Strong position in the wholesale produce sector
   ✓ Demonstrated staying power through market changes
   ✓ Located at the heart of Hamilton's commercial district

I'm pursuing an "Entrepreneurship Through Acquisition" (ETA) path - acquiring an
established, profitable business rather than starting from scratch. I'm specifically
looking for businesses with:

   • Proven track record (15+ years)
   • Revenue in the $1M-$1.5M range
   • Strong operational foundation
   • Owner potentially considering succession planning

WHY THIS MATTERS TO YOU:

Many business owners who've built something valuable over decades face a common
challenge: what happens next? Whether you're considering retirement, pursuing new
ventures, or simply exploring options, I'd like to have a confidential conversation
about what a transition might look like.

MY APPROACH:

Unlike private equity firms looking to strip value, I'm looking to:
   • Preserve the business's legacy and reputation
   • Retain key employees and relationships
   • Continue serving your customer base
   • Build on the foundation you've created

NEXT STEPS:

If you're open to a brief, confidential conversation, I'd be happy to:
   1. Learn more about Fiddes' story and operations
   2. Share my background and vision
   3. Explore if there's mutual fit

No pressure, no obligations - just a conversation between business professionals.

Would you be available for a 20-minute call in the next week or two?

Best regards,
[YOUR NAME]
[YOUR PHONE]
[YOUR EMAIL]

P.S. - I understand this is likely unexpected. Many successful business owners don't
actively think about selling until the right opportunity presents itself. If now isn't
the right time, I respect that completely. But if you've ever wondered "what's next?",
let's talk.

EMAIL #2: Traynor's Bakery Wholesale Ltd.
================================================================================

SUBJECT: Honoring 77 Years - Conversation About Traynor's Future

Dear Traynor's Bakery Leadership,

I'm reaching out with deep respect for what the Traynor family and team have built
since David Traynor started this business in 1948. 77 years of continuous operation
in Hamilton is a remarkable achievement.

My name is [YOUR NAME], and I'm exploring the acquisition of an established, profitable
business in the Hamilton area. Traynor's Bakery Wholesale caught my attention for
several compelling reasons:

   ✓ Nearly 25 years under current operation (since 2001)
   ✓ Third-generation legacy (since 1948)
   ✓ Strong wholesale distribution foundation
   ✓ Proven business model in competitive food industry

WHY I'M REACHING OUT:

I'm pursuing "Entrepreneurship Through Acquisition" (ETA) - acquiring and growing an
established business rather than starting from zero. I'm specifically seeking:

   • Businesses with proven longevity (15+ years)
   • Annual revenue in the $1M-$1.5M range
   • Strong customer relationships and operational systems
   • Owners considering succession planning

THE SUCCESSION CHALLENGE:

Businesses with your history often face a difficult question: How do we preserve what
we've built while ensuring a smooth transition? Whether you're:

   • Exploring retirement options
   • Concerned about succession planning
   • Considering strategic alternatives
   • Simply keeping options open

...a confidential conversation might be valuable.

WHAT MAKES THIS DIFFERENT:

I'm not a private equity firm looking to extract and exit. My approach:
   • Preserve Traynor's reputation and relationships
   • Retain experienced staff and operational knowledge
   • Continue serving your long-standing customers
   • Build on 77 years of goodwill and expertise

Since 1948, the Traynor name has meant quality and reliability in Hamilton. That
legacy deserves to be honored, not dismantled.

MY PROPOSAL:

A brief, confidential conversation where we:
   1. Discuss Traynor's history and current operations
   2. Explore your vision for the business's future
   3. Determine if there's a path forward that makes sense

No obligations. No pressure. Just a professional discussion.

Would you be open to a 20-30 minute call in the coming weeks?

Best regards,
[YOUR NAME]
[YOUR PHONE]
[YOUR EMAIL]

P.S. - David Traynor built something special in 1948. If the current leadership is
thinking about what comes next for Traynor's, let's ensure the next chapter honors
the previous 77 years. I'd welcome the opportunity to discuss how that might look.

FOLLOW-UP EMAIL TEMPLATE (Send 7-10 days after no response)
================================================================================

SUBJECT: Re: [Original Subject Line]

Hi [Name/Team],

I wanted to briefly follow up on my message from last week regarding [Business Name].

I understand you may be busy or this might not be the right time. However, I wanted
to emphasize a few points:

   • This inquiry is completely confidential
   • There's no obligation or pressure
   • Many business owners I speak with appreciate having the conversation, even if
     they're not ready to move forward now

Sometimes the hardest part is simply starting the conversation. If you're curious
about what an acquisition might look like, or if you've ever wondered "what would
happen if I decided to step back?", I'd be happy to discuss.

If you're not interested, a quick reply saying so is totally fine - I respect your
time and decision.

Otherwise, would you be available for a brief call?

Best,
[YOUR NAME]
