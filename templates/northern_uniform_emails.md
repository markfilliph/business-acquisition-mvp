**Subject:** Honoring 123 Years of Canadian Uniform Excellence

Dear Northern Uniform Leadership,

I came across Northern Uniform while researching Hamilton's most enduring businesses, and I was genuinely impressed by your 123-year journey since 1901. 

What strikes me most is how you've maintained your family-owned values while serving Hamilton's steel industry through multiple generations. Your specialized P.A.S.S. Program for high-visibility safety uniforms demonstrates the kind of innovation that builds lasting legacies.

As a business broker specializing in preserving family legacies, I work with buyers who deeply respect what founders and families have built. I'm curious if you've ever considered discussions about ensuring Northern Uniform's values and heritage continue for the next century.

Would you be open to a brief, confidential conversation about legacy preservation strategies? I'd be honored to share how other century-old businesses have successfully planned for their next chapter.

Best regards,
