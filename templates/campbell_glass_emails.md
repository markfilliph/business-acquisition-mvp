## EMAIL 1: LEGACY PRESERVATION (149 words)

**Subject:** Celebrating the Artistic Vision Behind Campbell Glass

Dear Manny and Zena,

I was researching Hamilton's most respected businesses when Campbell Glass & Mirror caught my attention - particularly the story of how Manny's artistic background transformed the company after 1988.

Your Consumer Choice Award and the loyalty you've built (employees staying 10-20+ years) speaks to something special. The 4,000 sq ft showroom on Ottawa Street has clearly become a Hamilton landmark.

As someone who works with family businesses, I'm curious about your long-term vision for Campbell Glass. Have you considered how to ensure your artistic legacy and the relationships you've built continue to flourish?

I work with buyers who deeply appreciate craftsmanship and would preserve the creative culture you've established while potentially expanding your reach.

Would you be open to a brief conversation about legacy preservation options that honor what you've built?

Respectfully,

## EMAIL 2: GROWTH PARTNERSHIP (144 words)

**Subject:** Digital Growth Opportunity for Award-Winning Glass Artisans

Dear Manny and Zena,

Campbell Glass & Mirror's artistic reputation and Consumer Choice Award recognition reveal massive untapped potential in the digital space.

I see an incredible opportunity: your artistic vision combined with e-commerce could reach customers across Ontario who currently can't access your Ottawa Street showroom. Imagine virtual consultations, online portfolio showcasing, and residential market expansion.

I work with growth partners who specialize in scaling artistic businesses while preserving their creative essence. They provide digital marketing expertise, e-commerce platforms, and expansion capital - not to change what you do, but to share it with more people.

Your long-term employees and artistic culture would remain intact while the business grows significantly.

Would you be interested in exploring how a partnership could amplify Campbell Glass's artistic impact across a much larger market?

Best regards,
