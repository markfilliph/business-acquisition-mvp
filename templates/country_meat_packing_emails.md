## EMAIL 1: LEGACY PRESERVATION (148 words)

**Subject:** Celebrating Three Generations of Meat Packing Excellence

Dear Albert and Benjamin Boekestein,

I recently learned about Country Meat Packing's remarkable three-generation journey since 1976, and I was particularly impressed by the recent father-son partnership that brought Benjamin into the business in 2022.

What Ben and Jane Boekestein started nearly 50 years ago has clearly grown into something special under Albert's 38 years of leadership. Now watching Benjamin continue the family tradition represents the best of Canadian family business.

As someone who works with multi-generational family businesses, I'm curious about your long-term vision for Country Meat Packing. Have you considered how to ensure this family legacy continues to thrive for future generations?

I'd be honored to discuss legacy preservation strategies that other three-generation businesses have used to secure their family heritage while exploring growth opportunities.

Would a brief conversation about preserving family business traditions be valuable?

Best regards,

Your recent father-son partnership at Country Meat Packing presents an exciting growth opportunity. With Albert's 38 years of experience and Benjamin's fresh perspective, you're perfectly positioned for expansion.

I see tremendous potential in your operation:

I work with growth partners who specialize in scaling family food businesses while preserving their personal touch. They provide capital, technology expertise, and distribution networks without disrupting family operations.

Your three-generation reputation for quality would be a huge advantage in expanded markets.

Would you be interested in exploring how a partnership could significantly grow Country Meat Packing while keeping the Boekestein family legacy central?
