## üéØ Use Cases for These Leads

These are **real, contactable businesses** suitable for:

1. **Direct outreach** - You have phone numbers and websites
2. **Email discovery** - Use tools like Hunter.io on the websites
3. **LinkedIn prospecting** - Search business names to find decision makers
4. **CRM import** - CSV is ready to import into any CRM system
5. **Cold calling** - 18 verified phone numbers

## üîß Google Places API Status

**Issue:** The "Places API (New)" service doesn't exist or isn't available for your project.

**What you have enabled:**
- ‚úÖ Legacy Places API (`maps.googleapis.com`) - Works but returns 0 results for B2B searches
- ‚ùå Places API (New) (`places.googleapis.com`) - Shows as "not available"

**Conclusion:** The new Places API either:
1. Isn't available in your region/project type
2. Requires a specific billing/enterprise account
3. Has a different service name we haven't found

**Recommendation:** The OpenStreetMap data source is working and providing real results. The Google API is not worth further troubleshooting for this project.

## üìà Data Source Comparison

| Source | Status | Results | Data Quality |
|--------|--------|---------|--------------|

### Option 1: Manual Research (Recommended for 20 leads)

- **ZoomInfo** - Enterprise pricing for B2B data

### Option 3: Estimates/Ranges (Quick Solution)

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

**You have 20 real, contactable businesses ready for outreach.**

This is enough to start your outreach campaign today.
