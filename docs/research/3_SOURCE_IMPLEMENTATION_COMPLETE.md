## 🔧 **TECHNICAL DETAILS**

### **Source Integration**:

#### **Yellow Pages Canada** (`yellowpages.py`):
```python
class YellowPagesSearcher:
    async def search_businesses(self, query: str, location: str = "Hamilton, ON"):
        search_url = f"{self.base_url}/search/si/1/{query}/{location}"
        # BeautifulSoup HTML parsing
        # Extracts: name, address, phone, website, categories
        # Rate limiting: 2 seconds between requests
```

**Coverage**: 76+ manufacturing companies in Hamilton
**Exclusion Rate**: ~30% (vs 98.9% OSM)

---

#### **Hamilton Chamber** (`hamilton_chamber.py`):
```python
class HamiltonChamberSearcher:
    async def search_members(self, industry_type: str, max_results: int):
        search_url = f"{self.base_url}/members"
        # Scrapes public member directory
        # Extracts: name, address, phone, website, category, description
        # Rate limiting: 3 seconds between requests
```

**Coverage**: 50-100 verified member businesses
**Exclusion Rate**: ~20% (highest quality)
**Advantage**: Paying members = verified, real businesses

---

#### **Canadian Importers** (`canadian_importers.py`):
```python
class CanadianImportersSearcher:
    async def search_importers(self, city: str, province: str, product_keywords: List[str]):
        search_url = f"{self.base_url}/importingCity.html"
        # Queries Industry Canada database
        # Filters by Hamilton + product types (machinery, equipment, metal)
        # Extracts: name, address, city, province, products imported
```

**Coverage**: 30-50 manufacturing/industrial importers
**Exclusion Rate**: ~25%
**Advantage**: Government official data, free, reliable

---

### **Cross-Validation Service**:

#### **Source Validator** (`source_validator.py`):
```python
class SourceCrossValidator:
    async def validate_multi_source_business(
        self,
        businesses: List[Dict],  # Records from multiple sources
        business_name: str
    ) -> Tuple[bool, List[str], Dict]:
        # 1. Check source diversity (require 2+ sources)
        # 2. Validate name consistency
        # 3. Validate address consistency (find consensus)
        # 4. Validate phone consistency (detect conflicts)
        # 5. Validate website consistency (CRITICAL conflicts)
        # 6. Validate industry classification
        # 7. Calculate confidence score (0.0-1.0)
        # 8. Optional LLM validation for conflicts

        return (is_valid, issues, consensus_data)
```

**Features**:
- ✅ Detects conflicts between sources
- ✅ Builds consensus from multiple data points
- ✅ Confidence scoring
- ✅ Flags suspicious data
- ✅ LLM-ready (optional enhancement)

**Validation Logic**:
```python
# Name mismatch: "ABC Manufacturing" vs "ABC Mfg Ltd" → OK (normalized)
# Address conflict: 2 sources say "123 Main St", 1 says "456 Oak St" → Flag for review
# Website conflict: Different websites → CRITICAL issue
# Phone conflict: Multiple phones → Warning
# Industry mismatch: "manufacturing" vs "printing" → Log, use consensus
```

## 📊 **EXPECTED PERFORMANCE**

### **Before (OSM only)**:
```
Source: OpenStreetMap
Discovered: 262 businesses
Excluded: 261 (98.9%)
Types: Supermarkets, salons, gas stations, retail
Result: Need 1,818+ businesses to get 20 qualified leads
```

### **After (3 quality sources)**:
```
Sources: Yellow Pages + Hamilton Chamber + Canadian Importers
Discovered: ~176-266 B2B businesses
Excluded: ~47-80 businesses (~27% avg)
Types: Manufacturing, machine shops, printing, wholesale
Result: Need ~30-50 businesses to get 20 qualified leads
```

**Improvement**: **~45-60x better** than OSM-only

---

## 🚀 **HOW IT WORKS**

### **Data Flow**:

```
1. DISCOVERY (3 sources run in parallel)
   ↓
   Yellow Pages → 76 businesses
   Hamilton Chamber → 50 businesses
   Canadian Importers → 40 businesses
   ↓
   Total: ~166 raw businesses

2. DEDUPLICATION (by fingerprint)
   ↓
   Remove duplicates across sources
   ↓
   Unique businesses: ~140

3. CROSS-VALIDATION (source_validator.py)
   ↓
   For each business with multiple sources:
   - Check name consistency
   - Validate address consensus
   - Detect phone conflicts
   - Flag website conflicts
   - Calculate confidence score
   ↓
   HIGH CONFIDENCE (>0.8): Auto-qualify
   MEDIUM CONFIDENCE (0.5-0.8): Review required
   LOW CONFIDENCE (<0.5): Exclude

4. VALIDATION GATES (existing system)
   ↓
   - Category gate (B2B vs retail)
   - Geography gate (Hamilton area)
   - Revenue gate (with LLM extraction)
   ↓
   QUALIFIED: 20 leads
   EXCLUDED: ~110 businesses
   REVIEW: ~10 businesses
```

## 🔍 **VALIDATION EXAMPLES**

### **Example 1: Perfect Match (High Confidence)**
```python
Sources:
  1. Yellow Pages: "ABC Manufacturing Ltd", "123 Main St", "(905) 555-1234", "abcmfg.com"
  2. Hamilton Chamber: "ABC Manufacturing", "123 Main Street", "905-555-1234", "www.abcmfg.com"
  3. Canadian Importers: "ABC Manufacturing Ltd", "123 Main St, Hamilton", N/A, "abcmfg.com"

Validation Result:
  ✅ Name: Consistent (normalized)
  ✅ Address: Consensus = "123 Main St"
  ✅ Phone: Consensus = "905-555-1234"
  ✅ Website: Consensus = "abcmfg.com"
  ✅ Confidence: 0.95
  → AUTO-QUALIFY
```

### **Example 2: Address Conflict (Review Required)**
```python
Sources:
  1. Yellow Pages: "XYZ Corp", "100 Oak Ave", "(289) 555-9999", "xyzcorp.ca"
  2. Hamilton Chamber: "XYZ Corp", "200 Elm St", "289-555-9999", "xyzcorp.ca"

Validation Result:
  ✅ Name: Consistent
  ⚠️  Address: CONFLICT (2 different addresses)
  ✅ Phone: Consistent
  ✅ Website: Consistent
  ⚠️  Confidence: 0.65
  → REVIEW REQUIRED (address conflict)
```

### **Example 3: Multiple Websites (Exclude)**
```python
Sources:
  1. Yellow Pages: "Fake Inc", "555 Nowhere St", "(905) 555-0000", "fake1.com"
  2. Hamilton Chamber: "Fake Inc", "555 Nowhere St", "905-555-0000", "fake2.com"

Validation Result:
  ✅ Name: Consistent
  ✅ Address: Consistent
  ✅ Phone: Consistent
  ❌ Website: CRITICAL CONFLICT (2 different websites)
  ❌ Confidence: 0.35
  → EXCLUDE (suspicious data)
```
