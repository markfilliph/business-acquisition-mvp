    type='establishment'
)

## üéØ ACTION PLAN FOR 20 HIGH-QUALITY LEADS

### Phase 1: Data Collection (Automated)
```bash
# Use existing OSM leads
python3 src/pipeline/quick_generator.py 50
# Generates 50 leads with basic data
```

### Phase 2: Google Places Enhancement (Semi-Automated)
```python
# For each OSM lead:
# 1. Search Google Places by name + address
# 2. Get Place ID
# 3. Fetch Place Details (phone, website, etc.)
# 4. Merge with OSM data
```

### Phase 3: Website Scraping (Automated)
```python
# For leads with websites:
# 1. Fetch website HTML
# 2. Search for patterns:
#    - "since 19XX" or "since 20XX"
#    - "team of X" or "X employees"
#    - "founded in YYYY"
# 3. Extract and save
```

### Phase 4: Manual Research (Top 20)
```
For each of the top 20 qualified leads:
1. Visit LinkedIn company page
   ‚Üí Note employee count
2. Visit website About page
   ‚Üí Verify founding year
3. Google the business
   ‚Üí Check recent news, verify still operating
4. Call business (optional)
   ‚Üí Verify contact info
```

## üí∞ COST ANALYSIS

### Google Places API:
- **Cost:** ~$17 per 1000 Place Details requests
- **For 20 leads:** $0.34 (negligible)
- **For 100 leads:** $1.70
- **For 1000 leads:** $17

**Verdict:** Worth it for quality data

### LinkedIn Sales Navigator:
- **Cost:** $99/month (individual) to $1000s/month (enterprise)
- **Verdict:** Expensive, only if scaling to 1000s of leads

### Manual Research:
- **Cost:** Your time (~5-10 min per lead)
- **For 20 leads:** 2-3 hours
- **Verdict:** Worth it for critical missing data

## ‚úÖ RECOMMENDATION

**For 20 qualified leads RIGHT NOW:**

1. Use the 20 leads already generated from OSM ‚úÖ
2. Get Google Places API key (free $200 credit)
3. Enhance those 20 leads with Google data
4. Manually research the top 20 on LinkedIn/websites
5. Result: 20 leads with maximum verified data

**Files already generated:**
- `output/quick_leads_20251002_085947.json` - 20 OSM leads
- `output/NEW_20_LEADS_SUMMARY_20251002.txt` - Summary

**Next step:**
1. Get Google API key
2. Create enhancement script
3. Run enhancement on existing 20 leads
4. Manual verification

---

## üìù CONCLUSION

**Reality:** Professional business data is:
- Protected by anti-scraping measures (YellowPages, BBB, Yelp)
- Expensive to access (LinkedIn, paid APIs)
- Requires manual effort for completeness

**Best path forward:**
- OSM for initial discovery (free, works)
- Google Places for enrichment (cheap, worth it)
- Website scraping for specific fields
- Manual research for critical data
- Quality over quantity

**We already have 20 real, validated businesses from OSM. The missing piece is employee count and years - best obtained through Google Places API + manual research.**
