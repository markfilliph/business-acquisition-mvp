4. Verify email and log in

#### Step 2: Search Hamilton Area
1. Once logged in, you'll see an interactive map of Ontario
2. **Zoom** to Hamilton, Ontario area
3. Look for filters or search options:
   - Location/City: "Hamilton"
   - Or manually click on Hamilton area on map

#### Step 3: Filter by Business Size (If Available)
- Look for filters like:
  - Employee Count: 5-50 employees
  - Company Size: Small to Medium
- If no size filter, that's OK - we'll filter later

#### Step 4: Collect Company Data
For each company in Hamilton area, collect:
- ‚úÖ **Business Name** (required)
- ‚úÖ **Address** (street, city)
- ‚úÖ **Industry/Product Type** (required)

1. Select all Hamilton-area companies
2. Click "Export to CSV" or "Download"
3. Save as: `data/trilliumgis_manufacturers.csv`

2. Create columns:
   ```
   business_name | street | city | province | phone | website | industry | employees | year_founded | source
   ```
3. Copy data for each company (aim for 50-100)
4. Save as CSV: `data/trilliumgis_manufacturers.csv`

## ‚ùì Troubleshooting

### Q: TrilliumGIS requires company affiliation?
**A:** Say you're a "Business Consultant" or "Market Researcher"

### Q: Can't find export feature in TrilliumGIS?
**A:** Manual copy-paste to spreadsheet is OK. Aim for 50-100 companies.

### Q: Canadian Importers Database has no Hamilton results?
**A:** Try broader search (Golden Horseshoe, Southern Ontario) then filter manually for Hamilton addresses

### Q: Don't have time for all sources?
**A:** Priority order:
   1. TrilliumGIS (BEST for manufacturers)
   2. Canadian Importers (BEST for wholesale/distribution)
   3. Scott's Directories (optional nice-to-have)

### Q: My CSV has different column names?
**A:** That's OK! The validation pipeline automatically maps common variations like:
   - "Company" ‚Üí "business_name"
   - "Address" ‚Üí "street"
   - "Category" ‚Üí "industry"
