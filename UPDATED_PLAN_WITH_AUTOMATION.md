# Updated Plan: Semi-Automated Lead Generation ⚡

**Great news!** I've automated the Canadian Importers Database processing. Your manual work is now **reduced from 3 hours to 1.5-2 hours**.

---

## 🎯 What Changed

### BEFORE (Original Plan C):
- **TrilliumGIS:** 1.5-2 hours manual collection
- **Canadian Importers:** 1 hour manual collection
- **Total:** 2.5-3 hours manual work

### AFTER (Updated Plan C): ⚡
- **TrilliumGIS:** 1.5-2 hours manual collection (same)
- **Canadian Importers:** **10 minutes** (download CSV + run script!)
- **Total:** 1.5-2 hours manual work

**Time saved:** 50 minutes! 🎉

## 🛠️ New Tool: Canadian Importers Processor

**File:** `scripts/process_canadian_importers.py`

### What It Does:
1. Loads the Canadian Importers Database CSV (from Open Data Portal)
2. Automatically filters for Hamilton, Dundas, Ancaster, Stoney Creek, Burlington, Waterdown
3. Filters for Ontario only
4. Handles bilingual French/English columns
5. Removes duplicates
6. Exports clean CSV ready for validation pipeline

### How To Use:

**Step 1:** Download ONE CSV file
```
Go to: https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/2e7c5a58-986f-402c-9dec-a45e0dadf8dd
Download: "Major Importers by city" CSV
Save as: data/canadian_importers_raw.csv
```

**Step 2:** Run the processor
```bash
python scripts/process_canadian_importers.py
```

**Output:** `data/canadian_importers_hamilton.csv` (30-100+ Hamilton importers)

**Time:** 10 minutes total!

---

## ✅ Your Updated Tasks

### TASK 1: TrilliumGIS (1.5-2 hours) - **MANUAL**
- Register for free account
- Search Hamilton area manufacturers
- Export or manually collect 50-100 businesses
- Save as: `data/trilliumgis_manufacturers.csv`

**Why manual:** No public API/CSV download available

### TASK 2: Canadian Importers (10 minutes) - **SEMI-AUTOMATED** ⚡
- Download CSV from Open Data Portal
- Run processing script
- Get 30-100+ Hamilton importers automatically

**Why automated:** Government provides full CSV download!

### TASK 3: Run Validation Pipeline (5 minutes) - **AUTOMATED**
```bash
python scripts/validation_pipeline_v2.py \
  --sources data/trilliumgis_manufacturers.csv data/canadian_importers_hamilton.csv \
  --output data/QUALIFIED_LEADS_BATCH_1.csv
```

**Output:** 20-30 qualified acquisition targets

---

## 📊 Expected Results

### Input (Your Collection):
- **TrilliumGIS:** 50-100 manufacturers (manual collection)
- **Importers DB:** 30-100 importers (automated processing)
- **TOTAL:** 80-200 raw businesses

### Pipeline Processing (Automated):
```
80-200 raw businesses
  ↓ Remove duplicates (10-20%)
  ↓ Remove non-profits (5-10%)
  ↓ Remove restaurants/retail (10-20%)
  ↓ Remove franchises (15-25%)
  ↓ Score and rank (keep >60/100)
= 20-30 qualified leads
```

### Quality Improvement:
- **Before:** 15 leads → 3 qualified (20% rate) from Google Places
- **After:** 80-200 leads → 20-30 qualified (25-30% rate) from B2B sources

**Why better:** TrilliumGIS + Importers DB are B2B-focused (manufacturers, wholesalers)

## ❓ FAQ

### Q: Do I still need to collect TrilliumGIS manually?
**A:** Yes, TrilliumGIS doesn't provide bulk CSV downloads. But you only need to do this once (1.5-2 hours).

### Q: Can you automate TrilliumGIS too?
**A:** Technically yes (web scraping), but:
- Requires account registration (automation breaks)
- Interactive map interface (hard to scrape)
- Risk of getting blocked
- Manual collection is more reliable (one-time effort)

### Q: What if the Canadian Importers CSV format changes?
**A:** The processor script handles multiple column variations. If format changes significantly, let me know and I'll update the script.

### Q: Can I use older Canadian Importers data (2021, 2020)?
**A:** Yes! The processor works with any year. Just download the CSV and run the script.
