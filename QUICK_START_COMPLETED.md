# Quick Start Tasks - COMPLETED

**Execution Date:** October 20, 2025
**Status:** ✅ All 3 Quick Start Tasks Complete

---

## 📊 Task 1: Strict Lead Filtering - COMPLETED

### Problem Identified
- Your existing 15 "qualified" leads all had `Revenue Max > $1.5M`
- Wide uncertainty ranges (±25-30%) pushed max values too high
- STRICT filtering (Revenue Max <= $1.5M) = 0 qualified leads

### Solution Implemented
Created **two filtering strategies**:

#### 1. `scripts/quick_filter.py` - Ultra-Strict Filter
- Filters: Revenue Max <= $1.5M, Years >= 15, Employees <= 30
- Excludes skilled trades
- Result: **0 leads qualified** (too conservative)

#### 2. `scripts/smart_revenue_filter.py` - Intelligent Filter ⭐ RECOMMENDED
- **Three strategies**:
  - STRICT: Revenue Max <= $1.5M → 0 leads
  - **MIDPOINT: Revenue Midpoint <= $1.5M → 2 leads** ✅
  - MIN: Revenue Min <= $1.5M → 11 leads

- **Recommended: MIDPOINT Strategy**
  - Balances risk vs. opportunity
  - Accounts for estimation uncertainty
  - Statistically likely to be under $1.5M

### Results
**2 QUALIFIED LEADS** using MIDPOINT strategy:

1. **Fiddes Wholesale Produce Co**
   - Revenue: $1.07M - $1.78M (Midpoint: $1.43M)
   - Years: 28.6
   - Employees: 5-20
   - Industry: Wholesale

2. **Traynor's Bakery Wholesale Ltd.**
   - Revenue: $1.07M - $1.78M (Midpoint: $1.43M)
   - Years: 24.4
   - Employees: 5-20
   - Industry: Wholesale Bakery

**Output File:** `data/QUALIFIED_LEADS_MIDPOINT_20251020_112512.csv`

## 🎯 IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS

### 1. Manual Research (2-3 hours)
Before sending emails, find:
- **Fiddes:** Current owner name (try LinkedIn, Ontario business registry)
- **Traynor's:** Current leadership (David Traynor founded in 1948, who runs it now?)

**How to find owner names:**
- LinkedIn: Search "[Business Name] Hamilton owner" or "president"
- Google: "[Business Name] owner" or "[Business Name] leadership"
- Ontario Business Registry: https://www.ontario.ca/page/business-name-search
- Call the business: "Hi, I'm looking to speak with the owner about a business matter"

### 2. Personalize Emails (30 minutes)
Once you have owner names:
- Replace `[YOUR NAME]` with your actual name
- Replace `[YOUR PHONE]` and `[YOUR EMAIL]`
- Add owner name to greeting: "Dear [Owner Name]" instead of "Dear Owner"
- Customize specific details based on research

### 3. Send First Outreach (Day 1)
**Fiddes Wholesale Produce:**
- Try to find personal email (LinkedIn, company site)
- Fallback: Send to Facebook page message
- Backup: Phone call to (905) 570-7900

**Traynor's Bakery:**
- Primary: `orderdesk@traynors.ca` (mention you'd like to reach ownership)
- Try to find direct owner email
- Backup: Phone call to (905) 522-2730

### 4. Follow-Up Sequence
- **Day 5:** Send follow-up email if no response
- **Day 7:** Attempt phone call
- **Day 14:** Final follow-up email
- **Day 21:** Mark as "not interested" and move to next leads

## 🎓 LESSONS LEARNED

### Revenue Filtering
- **Don't use strict max values** when estimates have wide uncertainty
- **Use midpoint or confidence-weighted filtering** instead
- **Account for estimation methodology** in your thresholds

### Lead Quality > Lead Quantity
- 2 high-quality, verified leads > 15 unfiltered leads
- Manual verification is critical before outreach
- Owner contact info is the bottleneck (not business discovery)

### Enrichment Challenges
- Facebook business pages have limited scraping data
- Historical founder info ≠ current owner info
- Email discovery requires multiple strategies (scraping + APIs + manual)

## ❓ QUESTIONS TO CONSIDER

Before scaling up, answer these:

1. **Financing Strategy:**
   - Do you have capital to acquire (~$1M+)?
   - Using SBA loan? Investor backing? Self-funded?
   - This affects your email credibility

2. **Timeline:**
   - How quickly do you want to close a deal?
   - Are you doing this full-time or part-time?
   - Affects outreach cadence

3. **Geographic Flexibility:**
   - Must be Hamilton, or can expand to other Ontario cities?
   - Affects scraper configuration

4. **Industry Preferences:**
   - Why wholesale/distribution? Is that flexible?
   - Affects filtering and scoring weights

5. **Broker vs. Direct:**
   - Will you use M&A broker if serious interest emerges?
   - Affects NDA and due diligence process
